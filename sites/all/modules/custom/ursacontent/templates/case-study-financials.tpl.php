					Before we started our work with a major financial institution, they relied on a relocation company and a tax provider to handle the majority of their global mobility needs. The processes used by each were manual and information about their overall program was hard to access.

Leveraging our software, we put a systematic approach in place for assignment initiation, cost estimates, balance sheets and payroll. More recently, we began providing expense management services and compensation collection reporting. The immediate result was greatly enhanced tax compliance and an understanding of their total assignment expenditures that they didn’t have before.</p>

In 2010, their merger with another financial institution resulted in a full policy review and the introduction of a core/optional policy approach that we supported. All of the merged assignee details were uploaded to Polaris as well, and we became the new merged company’s system of record.</p>
